# Professional README Generator Starter Code

Module 9 Challenge: Readme Generator

I created this project to work on node.js and utilizing inquirer and fs to create a readme.  

Things I learned from this project:

I learned how to properly call the inquire and fs packages to my index.js page.  

I learned how to utilize inquire best to create prompts for input and selection options.   

I then learned how to use the write to file function to create a new file.

Some challenges I had were figuring out which parameters to pass in the write to file functions.
